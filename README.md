Insert Right: Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
Delete: Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree.
Is Leaf: Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf.
Is Root: Write a function that checks if a given node is a root.
Pre-order Traversal: Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
In-order Traversal: Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal.
Post-order Traversal: Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal.
Height: Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree.
Depth: Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.
Size: Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree.
